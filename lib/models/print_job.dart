  /// - **Example**: A user sends a document to a busy office printer. The job enters the `pending` state while it waits for two other documents to finish printing.

  /// The job is currently being sent to the printer or is being printed.
  /// - **CUPS**: `IPP_JOB_PROCESSING` (5)

  /// The job has finished sending data to the printer. On some systems, this
  /// may be a transitional state before `completed`.
  /// - **Windows**: `JOB_STATUS_PRINTED` (128)

  /// The job has finished all processing and is considered fully complete.
  /// - **CUPS**: `IPP_JOB_COMPLETED` (9)

  /// The job was explicitly canceled by a user or an administrator.
  /// - **CUPS**: `IPP_JOB_CANCELED` (7)

  canceled('Canceled'),

  /// The job was aborted by the system due to an error or other condition.

  /// - **Example**: (CUPS) The printer loses power mid-print. When it comes back online, the CUPS server aborts the incomplete job.
  aborted('Aborted'),

  /// An error occurred that prevents the job from printing.
  /// - **Windows**: `JOB_STATUS_ERROR` (2)
  /// - **Example**: (Windows) The print driver is corrupted or incompatible with the data being sent, causing the job to enter an `error` state.

  /// The job status could not be determined.
  /// - **Example**: The plugin receives a status code from the operating system that doesn't map to any known state.

  /// The job is held and will not print until released.
  /// - **CUPS**: `IPP_JOB_HELD` (4)

  held('Held'), // CUPS

  /// The printer has been stopped, and the job is paused.
  /// - **CUPS**: `IPP_JOB_STOPPED` (6)

  stopped('Stopped'), // CUPS

  /// The job has been paused by a user or administrator.
  /// - **Windows**: `JOB_STATUS_PAUSED` (1)

  paused('Paused'), // Windows

  /// The job is being written to a spool file on the disk.
  /// - **Windows**: `JOB_STATUS_SPOOLING` (8)

  spooling('Spooling'), // Windows

  /// The job is in the process of being deleted.
  /// - **Windows**: `JOB_STATUS_DELETING` (4)
  /// - **Example**: (Windows) After a job is canceled, it briefly enters the `deleting` state while the system cleans up its associated spool file.
  deleting('Deleting'), // Windows

  /// The job has been restarted and is being printed again.
  /// - **Windows**: `JOB_STATUS_RESTART` (2048)
  /// - **Example**: (Windows) A job was blocked due to a printer error. After the error is resolved, the job is automatically `restarting`.
  restarting('Restarting'), // Windows

  /// The printer is offline.
  /// - **Windows**: `JOB_STATUS_OFFLINE` (32)

  offline('Offline'), // Windows

  /// The printer is out of paper.
  /// - **Windows**: `JOB_STATUS_PAPEROUT` (64)

  paperOut('Paper Out'), // Windows

  /// The printer requires user intervention (e.g., to load paper, fix a jam).

  /// The job is blocked, for example, because a preceding job has an error.
  /// - **Windows**: `JOB_STATUS_BLOCKED_DEVQ` (512)
